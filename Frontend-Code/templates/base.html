        <p> Surveillance security is a very tedious and time-consuming job. In this tutorial, we will build a system to automate the task of analyzing video surveillance. We will analyze the video feed in real-time and identify any abnormal activities like violence or theft. There is a lot of research going on in the industry about video surveillance among them; the role of CCTV videos has overgrown. CCTV cameras are placed all over the places for surveillance and security. In the last decade, there have been advancements in deep learning algorithms for deep surveillance. These advancements have shown an essential trend in deep surveillance and promise a drastic efficiency gain. The typical applications of deep surveillance are theft identification, violence detection, and detection of the chances of explosion. </p>
        <br><h2>Network architecture:</h2>
        <p>We have generally seen deep neural networks for computer vision, image classification, and object detection tasks. In this project, we have to extend deep neural networks to 3-dimensional for learning spatio-temporal features of the video feed.For this video surveillance project, we will introduce a spatio temporal autoencoder, which is based on a 3D convolution network. The encoder part extracts the spatial and temporal information, and then the decoder reconstructs the frames. The abnormal events are identified by computing the reconstruction loss using Euclidean distance between original and reconstructed batch.</p>
        <p>Let's see whether this model detects some abnormality or not, for that follow the given steps.</p>
        <p>1. Choose a test file from your system by clicking choose.</p>
        <div id="content" style="margin-top:2em">
          <form id="upload-file" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
            <label for="videoUpload" class="upload-label">
                Choose...
            </label>
            <input type="file" name="file" id="videoUpload" accept=".mp4, .avi">
          </form>
        <div>
            <p>2. Click on the test button and wait for a while.</p> 
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg " id="btn-test">Test</button>
